* Fix issue of ell in multiplication


* Make sure the ell values in BMSTransform and MoreschiIteration are consistent


* Clarify signs in the fixed-point iteration method


* Try to get the iterations working


* Rethink choices about time.  Should I be conflating the boost and translation?


* Sort out convention for whether or not to include time in supertranslation


* Try out the Moreschi method with
** pure boost
** pure translation
** pure supertranslation
** random BMS transformation


* Do I really need to use OneOverK everywhere, or could I derive v?


* Deal more carefully with multiplication/division and filtering modes
** Rewrite constructors to require explicit sizes


* Compare time-interpolation using modes of spherical harmonics, rather than values on grid points


* Redo boosts
** Check sign choices
** Derive the conformal factor independently of Frolov


* Clarify the tetrad conventions


* Re-derive Wigner D functions
** Expand polynomial differently for |R_a|<|R_b|
** Check cases R_a and R_b
** Implement in the code
** Add bounds checks for ell to all relevant higher-level functions


* Understand supertranslation behaviors of various spacetimes
** PN
** Our numerical simulations
*** CF
*** SKS
** Will's unholy union of PN and NR


* Implement mass-centering algorithm
** Test on mass-centered Schwarzschild
** Test on mass-offset Schwarzschild
** Test on boosted mass-centered Schwarzschild
** Test on boosted mass-offset Schwarzschild


* Make some variable names uniform
** alpha = rapidity
** beta = speed (in units of c)
** gamma = Lorentz factor
** delta = supertranslation
** kappa = spin coefficient [probably unused]
** K or Kappa = conformal factor





* Rewrite Waveform class in terms of Modes objects
** Think carefully about what information each object should have
